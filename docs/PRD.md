**Project:** 313 Connect

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:**  
313 Connect

**Summary (Elevator Pitch):**  
313 Connect is a peer-to-peer local network for Detroit that turns phone numbers into decentralized identifiers (DIDs). It allows residents to claim a 313 identity, verify it through mutual connections, and communicate directly through a community-based network that links physical locations, Wi-Fi access points, and local events.

**Owner / Maintainer:**  
John Gulbronson

**Related Documents:**
- PAD (Project Architecture Document)
- Platform Deployment Docs (PDD)
- Marketing Deployment Flow (MDF)

**Repository / Workspace:**  
github.com/detroitcommons/313connect

**Current Version:**  
v0.1 (Prototype / Proof of Concept)

## 2. Vision & Goals

**Mission Statement:**  
To establish a human-centered network that connects Detroiters through verified peer relationships, fostering trust, communication, and belonging in the digital and physical commons.

**Primary Goals:**
1. Create a decentralized local identity system tied to the 313 area code.
2. Enable peer-verified onboarding to promote authentic local connections.
3. Build local-first peer-to-peer communication using Wi-Fi-based verification.
4. Encourage community participation through localized events and nodes.

**Success Criteria / KPIs:**

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Verified users | 3,000+ | On-chain DID registrations |
| Connection rate | 2+ verified peers per user | Peer graph analysis |
| Active nodes | 10 community hubs | Node registration logs |
| Engagement | 25% monthly active users | App analytics |
| Local event participation | 500+ check-ins | Geo-verified interactions |

## 3. Problem Statement

**The Problem:**  
Detroit lacks a unified, community-owned digital network for residents to connect and verify one another without relying on centralized platforms. Existing tools fragment communication, ownership, and identity.

**Why It Matters:**  
A decentralized identity and local network empower residents to reclaim their data, strengthen community trust, and support hyperlocal economies through shared connectivity and reputation.

**Who It Affects:**
- Detroit residents seeking authentic local connections
- Artists, organizers, and small businesses promoting events
- Technologists building for civic engagement

**Current Limitations:**
- Centralized social media lacks locality and trust
- No verifiable system for community presence
- Limited access to Web3 identity tools for non-technical users

---

## 4. Target Users & Personas

**Primary Users:**
- **Local Residents** â€” want to connect with verified people nearby
- **Community Organizers** â€” use the platform to manage events and hubs
- **Local Businesses** â€” engage nearby audiences with offers and events

**Secondary Users:**
- **Developers** â€” integrate local-first APIs and DID-based auth
- **Civic Partners** â€” use 313 verification for community programs

**Example Persona:**  
**Name:** Tasha Walker  
**Role:** Event Organizer in Southwest Detroit  
**Goals:** Promote events to real locals, verify attendees, and form authentic collaborations  
**Pain Points:** Bots, unreliable event RSVPs, lack of local network visibility

## 5. Product Scope

### Core Features:

#### 1. Claim Your 313 Number:
- Choose a 3â€“6 digit number (e.g., "313562")
- Generate a private key tied to that number
- Store securely via wallet or cloud backup

#### 2. Peer Verification:
- Connect with one verified user to activate identity
- Optional location/Wi-Fi verification (local hotspot signature)

#### 3. Local Presence:
- Verify your "in Detroit" status by connecting to local Wi-Fi nodes (e.g., Spotlight, Assemble Sound, etc.)
- Event-based proof of presence

#### 4. Messaging & P2P Calls:
- Encrypted peer-to-peer calls between verified users
- Optional "drop zone" messaging for offline relays

#### 5. Network Map:
- Visualize local hubs, Wi-Fi-verified zones, and event hotspots

#### 6. Onboarding Flow (Marketing Flow v1):
- Visit landing page
- Enter phone number â†’ check availability
- "Claim" â†’ redirects to app download
- App confirms number with generated key
- Must connect with one verified user to activate

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|

| Technical scalability | Modular local-first data design |
| Limited initial adoption | Start with curated "313 Hubs" (Poplar Commons, etc.) |

---

## 10. Open Questions

1. Should DID verification rely on peer graph (Web of Trust) or zero-knowledge proofs?
2. Should phone numbers be numeric-only or include vanity word handles?
3. How do we manage re-claiming abandoned numbers?
4. Will peer calls be app-to-app only or also integrate SIP/VoIP?
